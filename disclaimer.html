            <h3>Answer Key Notice</h3>
            <p>All answer keys published on this website — including CBSE Class 10 Maths Standard 2025 (Sets 30/2/1, 30/2/2, 30/2/3) — are prepared for <strong>discussion and reference purposes only</strong>. Students should refer to the <strong>official CBSE marking scheme</strong> released by the Board for final confirmation of answers. CBSE Decision Hub is not responsible for any discrepancy between our discussion answers and the official evaluation scheme.</p>

        <!-- 1. Educational Purpose -->
        <div class="policy-section">
            <span class="section-num">Section 01</span>
            <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
            <p>CBSE Decision Hub is an independent educational platform created to assist CBSE Class 10 students with academic decision-making tools including percentage calculators, stream eligibility checkers, target mark planners, and answer key discussions.</p>
            <p>All content, tools, and resources provided on this website are intended purely for <strong>educational and informational purposes</strong>. They are not a substitute for guidance from certified educators, school counsellors, or official CBSE communications.</p>
            <div class="info-block">
                <p>✅ Use our tools to estimate, plan, and explore your options — but always confirm important decisions with your school, teachers, or official CBSE resources.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. Answer Key Disclaimer -->
        <div class="policy-section">
            <span class="section-num">Section 02</span>
            <h2>Answer Key Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Answer keys published on CBSE Decision Hub are created independently by our team based on standard mathematical principles and our analysis of the question paper. They are meant to help students cross-check their responses immediately after the exam and encourage discussion.</p>

            <div class="answer-key-section">
                <h3>📌 What This Means for Students</h3>
                <p>Our answer keys are unofficial reference materials. Here is what students must keep in mind:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>These answers are prepared for <strong>discussion and self-assessment</strong>, not official scoring.</li>
                    <li>CBSE's official marking scheme may include partial marking, alternate methods, or updated answers that differ from our discussion.</li>
                    <li>The final evaluation of your answer sheet is done entirely by CBSE-appointed examiners using the official marking scheme.</li>
                    <li>Do <strong>not</strong> treat our answer key as the definitive or authoritative source for your score prediction.</li>
                    <li>Always wait for and refer to the official CBSE answer key or result when available.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>We make every effort to ensure accuracy in our answer discussions. However, we acknowledge that errors are possible and welcome corrections from the academic community via our <a href="contact.html" style="color:var(--primary); font-weight:600;">contact page</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. No Official Affiliation -->
        <div class="policy-section">
            <span class="section-num">Section 03</span>
            <h2>No Official Affiliation with CBSE</h2>
            <p>CBSE Decision Hub is an <strong>independent website</strong>. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or in any way officially connected to:</p>

                <li>The Ministry of Education, Government of India</li>
                <li>Any school, coaching institute, or educational board</li>
            </ul>
            <p>References to "CBSE" on this website are used solely to describe the context of the tools — i.e., they are designed for students studying under the CBSE curriculum. The CBSE name and logo are trademarks of the Central Board of Secondary Education.</p>

        <!-- 4. Accuracy Limitation -->
        <div class="policy-section">
            <span class="section-num">Section 04</span>
            <h2>Accuracy Limitation</h2>
            <p>We make a sincere effort to ensure that all tools and content on CBSE Decision Hub are accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with current CBSE rules and guidelines. However, we cannot guarantee complete accuracy at all times.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CBSE rules, calculation methods, and eligibility criteria may change between academic years. Always verify with official sources.</li>
                <li>Calculator results are based on the inputs you provide. Incorrect inputs will produce incorrect results.</li>
                <li>Answer key discussions reflect our best analysis but are subject to revision if official information differs.</li>
                <li>Stream eligibility guidelines vary by school. Results from our tool are indicative and not binding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We strongly recommend using our tools as a starting point for understanding — not as the final word on any academic decision.</p>
